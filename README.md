# Overview 
Demonstration of algorithms and techniques on Image Processing and Classification. Some examples are gamma adjustment, histogram normalization, use of sharpening kernels (file enhancement.py), and edge/object detection using a variety of methods (Prewitt, Roberts, Sobel, Laplacian kernels, Canny algorithm, Hough transform, file edges_corners.py). Besides these, the problem of detecting pneumona from chest X-Ray images (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) is tackled in the file pneumonia_classification.py. 
# How to use/libraries used
The code should run out of the box after downloading, provided you have the following libraries installed: opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, skimage, sklearn, keras/tensorflow (for the neural network part).
