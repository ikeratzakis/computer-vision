# Overview 
Demonstration of algorithms and techniques on Image Processing. Some examples are gamma adjustment, histogram normalization, use of sharpening kernels (file enhancement.py), and edge/object detection using a variety of methods (Prewitt, Roberts, Sobel, Laplacian kernels, Canny algorithm, Hough transform, file edges_corners.py).  
# How to use/libraries used
The code should run out of the box after downloading, provided you have the following libraries installed: opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, skimage, sklearn,
